# TenantSage — The Architecture of Trust

TenantSage is a governed knowledge architecture designed for complex,
multi-property and multi-branch organisations where trust, isolation,
and compliance are non-negotiable.

This repository hosts the **public static site** describing the
TenantSage architectural framework.

## What TenantSage Is

TenantSage is **not** a chatbot, AI model, or RAG tool.

It is an architectural framework that embeds organisational trust,
tenant isolation, and access governance directly into the data model
and retrieval process, ensuring that AI systems operate exclusively
within verified, authorised, and compliant knowledge boundaries.

---

## Architecture Principles

- Family-Tenant isolation enforced at the data layer
- Role-based, assignment-based, and time-bound governance
- Controlled document retrieval prior to AI interaction
- Deterministic and audit-ready access decisions
